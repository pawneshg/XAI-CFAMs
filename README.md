# CAM

### Goal:
The goal of this project is to predict how much percentage a convolutional neural network takes an object's features and its background features into account.

### Methods Used:
##### 1. Class Activation Maps: 
##### 2. Computation of Omega value:
##### 3. Computation of Evaluation matrix: 
##### 4. Predict the foreground/background percentage areas focused by CNNs.
